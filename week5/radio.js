//Radio Commercials
//Our favorite Onid Pizza would like to have a commercial aired in a radio. Since they are close to KTH, they want to attract mainly students. It’s not a good idea to have the commercial aired between 8 am and 5 pm, because most of the students are in the school and don’t listen to the radio. Onid made a survey and now they know how many students listen to the radio at each point of the day.
//
//They also know that if each student listens to a commercial, he or she will spend one Swedish crown on pizza in expectation. Thus if 100 students listen to a commercial, Onid will increase their income by 100 crowns on average from selling more pizza.
//
//Of course, Onid Pizza has to pay a fixed amount every time the commercial is played. The radio has a commercial break every 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Onid can choose only one continuous sequence of commercial breaks, for example all breaks from 5 pm to 8 pm. Help them to choose a continuous sequence of commercial breaks such that their profit is maximal.
